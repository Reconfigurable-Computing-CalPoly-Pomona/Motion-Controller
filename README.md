**Motion-Controller**
This work has been done as a collaboration between California State Polytechnic University Pomona and Xilinx on developing a reconfigurable motion controller on the PYNQ-Z1 FPGA kit. The proposed architecture depends on using S-Curve for controlling the motion on the rail with another set up for proof of concept. S-Curve algorithm used instead of using the Trapezoidal profile for this purpose.
